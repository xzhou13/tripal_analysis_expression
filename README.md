# Introduction 
Tripal Analysis: Expression is a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) module built to extend the functionality of the [Tripal](http://tripal.info/) toolset.
The purpose of the module is to visually represent gene expression for Tripal features. This module requires the following Tripal modules:

1. Tripal Core
2. Tripal Views
3. Tripal DB
4. Tripal CV
5. Tripal Analysis
6. Tripal Feature
7. Tripal Organism
8. Tripal Contact

# Installation
1. Click on the green "Clone or download" button on the top right corner of this page to obtain the web URL. Download this module by running ```git clone <URL> ``` on command line. 
2. Place the module folder inside your /sites/all/modules/{modulename} or sites/all/themes/{themename} folder (for more instructions, read the [Drupal documentation page](https://www.drupal.org/node/120641).

# Module Features

### Content Types
The is module provides four content types - Analysis: Expression, Biomaterial, Array Design, and Protocol. 

1. Analysis: Expression - The analysis: expression content type it built by hooking into the Tripal 2 Analysis module. This content type was modeled after the content types provided by the [Tripal InterPro Analysis](https://www.drupal.org/project/tripal_analysis_interpro) module and the [Tripal Blast Analysis](https://www.drupal.org/project/tripal_analysis_blast) module. This content type provides an interface to describe the experiment from which expression data was gathered. This content type provides the ability to describe either microarray expression data or next generation sequencing expression data (such as data obtained from RNASeq). This content type also provides a form to load expression data associated with the analysis.

2. Biomaterial - The biomaterial content type represents the Chado biomaterial table. The Chado biomaterial table is a member of the Chado MAGE module. The biomaterial content type is similar to the [BioSample](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK169436/) content type provided by [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). See the biomaterial description at the [GMOD wiki](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_Mage_Module#Table:_biomaterial).

3. Array Design - The array design content type represents the Chado arraydesign table. This table is only used when describing the experimental design of data collected from a microarray expression experiment. See the arraydesign description at the [GMOD wiki](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_Mage_Module#Table:_arraydesign).

5. Protocol - The protocol content type represents the Chado protocol table. This table is used to describe the protocol, software, and hardware used in different steps of the experiment. See the protocol description at the [GMOD wiki](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_Tables#Table:_protocol).

### Module Administrative Pages
For each of the above content types, this module provides full administrative capabilities which includes the following, administrative list of content, sync, delete, TOC (table of contents), settings, and help pages. These pages were modeled after and created using other Tripal modules. 

### User Searches
A simple anonymous user search (using Views) is also provided for each content type. These searches can be foud at the following urls:

site_name/chado/analysis-expression

site_name/chado/arraydesign

site_name/chado/biomaterial

site_name/chado/protocol

### Data Loaders
Two loaders are provided by this module, a biomaterial loader, and an expression loader. The biomaterial loader has the ability to load data from a flat file or from an xml file downloaded from NCBI. The expression loader is included in the analysis: expression content type form.

### Expression Display
Once expression data is loaded. A display will be shown on each feature page that has corresponding biomaterials and expression values.

# Loading Biomaterials
Biomaterials may be loaded from a flat file or from an BioSample xml file downloaded from NCBI. The steps for loading biomaterials are as follows (detailed instructions can be found further below):

1. [First download or generate the flat (.csv, .tsv) or .xml file with biomaterials data you want to load](#downloading-xml-biosample-file-from-ncbi).
2. Navigate to the Tripal site's Tripal Biomaterial Loader to submit the job with [a .xml file](#loading-ncbi-xml-biosample-file-into-tripal) or [a flat file](#loading-biomaterials-from-a-flat-file). Run the job via command line with Drush command. Pay attention to error and warning messages. 
3. [For newly added biomaterial(s), sync the biomaterial(s) on the Tripal site. Run the sync job via command line with Drush command](#syncing-biomaterials). Note that this step is not needed if biomaterial with the same "sample_name" already exists in the database. In that case, the database entries for that biomaterial should be updated.  
4. Verify that the biomaterial(s) loaded correctly by viewing it via "Find content".

### Downloading XML BioSample File From NCBI
To obtain a xml BioSample file from ncbi go the [NCBI BioSample database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/). Search for and select the BioSamples you would like to download. 
![Select BioSamples](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14822959/12490120/f5223ad8-c041-11e5-93ac-4692e27bf3d1.png)

Click the "Send to:" link. Then select "File" and select "Full XML (text)" as the format. Then click "Create File". 
![Download BioSample XML File](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14822959/12490242/8cb8b796-c042-11e5-82dc-7a723867ea7a.png)

### Loading NCBI XML BioSample File into Tripal
To upload the file into Chado/Tripal, Navigate to:  
**Tripal->Extensions->Expression Analysis->Tripal Biomaterial Loader**

Select the organism for which you are uploading expression data. Select "NCBI biosample xml file" and then write the path in "File Path" field.

After clicking "Submit job", the page should reload with the job status and Drush command to run the job. Copy and paste the Drush command and run it on command line. Upon running the Drush command, any warning/error/success/status message should be displayed.

Similarily, after clicking "Submit job", the page should reload with the job status and Drush command to run the job. Copy and paste the Drush command and run it on command line. Upon running the Drush command, any warning/error/success/status message should be displayed.

### Loading Biomaterials From a Flat File

Altenatively biomaterials may be loaded from a flat file (CSV or TSV). The flat file loader is designed to upload files that are in the [NCBI BioSample submission format](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/template/) which can be downloaded [here](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/template/). Download the TSV version of the file. The file must have a header that specifies the type of data in the column. There must be one column labeled "sample\_name". The loader will begin to collect data from the line that follows the line containing "sample\_name" which is assumed to be the header line. Columns are not required to be in any order. Other columns will be either attributes or accessions. Available NCBI [attributes](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/template/) can be found [here](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/template/). Available accession headers are bioproject\_accession, sra\_accession, biosample\_accession. All other columns will be uploaded as properties. To upload other accessions use the bulk loader provided with this module labeled, "Biomaterial Accession Term Loader". This loader will load a flat file with 3 columns (sample name, database name, accession term). A Tripal database must be created with the same name as the database name in the upload file.   

![Flat File Loader](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14822959/12991558/a4b26a30-d0dd-11e5-8419-07216d0cbbc8.png)

### Syncing Biomaterials

After loading, biomaterials must be synced to create nodes for each biomaterial content type. As an administrator or user with correct permissions, navigate to **Tripal->Extensions->Expression Analysis->Tripal Expression Analysis Content Types->Biomaterial->SYNC**. Select the biomaterials to sync and click "Sync Biomaterials".

![Syncing Biomaterials](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14822959/12991663/243827d6-d0de-11e5-820c-4cae34974283.png)

Similarily, after clicking "Sync Biomaterials", run the Drush command on command line and monitor for any warnings/error messages.

### Loading a Single Biomaterial
Biomaterials may also be loaded one at a time. As an administer or a user with permission to create content, go to: **Add content->Biomaterial**. Available biomaterial fields include the following. 
* **Biomaterial Name (must be unique - required)**
* **Biomaterial description** - A description of the biomaterial.
* **Biomaterial Provider** - The person or organization responsible for collecting the biomaterial

There is also the ability to add properties or accession values to the biomaterial. 

# Loading Expression Data

### Creating the Experiment Setup
Before loading data, describe the experimental setup used to collect the data. As an administrator or a user with permission to create content, go to: **Add content->Analysis: Expression**. The "Analysis: Expression" content type is a sub-type of the analysis content type. It contains all fields used in the analysis content type as well as fields that allow the description of the experimental design and the data loader.

**Protocol Descripton** - The protocol content types can be created by navigating to **Add content->Protocol**. A protocol can be used to add extra detail to an experimental design. A protocol can be used to describe the assay, acquisition, and quantification steps of the experiment design. A protocol can also be used to further describe the array design content type. The fields of a protocol are:
* **Protocol Name (must be unique - required)**
* **Protocol Link** - A web address to a page that describes the protocol.
* **Protocol Description** - A description of the protocol.
* **Hardware Description** - A description of the wardware used in the protocol.

* **Publication** - A publication that describes the protocol.

#### Data Loader

The data loader fields provide a way for the user to load expression data associated with the experiment. The loader can load data from two types of formats, matrix and column. The matrix format expects a row of data containing biomaterials names. The first column should be unique feature names. Features must already be loaded into the database. Biomaterials will be added if not present. Expression values will map to a library in the column and a feature in the row. Only one matrix file may be loaded at a time. The column format expects the first column to contain features and the second column to be expression values. The biomaterial name will be taken as the name of the file minus the file extension. Features must already be loaded into the database. Biomaterials will be added if not present. Multiple column format files may be loaded at the same time given that the files are in the same directory and contain the same file suffix. Either format may have header or footer information. Regex can be used in the form to only record data after the header and before the footer. Any file suffix can be used. The data loader fields are the following:
* **Source File Type** - This can be either "Column Format" or "Matrix Format".
* **Checkbox** - Check this box to submit a job to parse the data into Chado.
* **File Type Suffix** - The suffix of the files to load. This is used to submit multiple column format files in the same directory. A suffix is not required for a matrix file.
* **File Path** - The  path to a single matrix or column format file. The path may also be set to a directory, in which case all column files with the "File Type Suffix" specified above will be loaded. When loading multiple files from a file suffix must be specified. 
* **Regex for Start of Data** - If the expression file has a header, use this field to capture the line that occurs before the start of expression data. This line of text and any text preceding this line will be ignored. 
* **Regex for End of Data** - If the expression file has a footer, use this field to capture teh line that occurs after the end of expression data. This line of text and all text following will be ignored.
